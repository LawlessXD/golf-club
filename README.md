## UX

The objective of this website is to provide information to members of the public about the golf course, where the course is located and cost to play a game of golf. The site also provides information on the membership options available and a call to action button on the homepage to become a member.

### Strategy

Build a static front-end website for a local golf club using a mobile-first approach. As a user of the golf club, I found it frustrating that I couldn't use the current website without zooming in on the content. 

The primary audience for the website are members of the public looking to play a game of golf, get information about the course with the possibilty of becoming a member. 
- As a potential new Customer, I want to be able to find out information about the course.
- As a potential new Customer, I want to be able to find out the current green fees.
- As a potential new Customer, I want to be able to find out where the course is located.
- As a potential new member, I want to be able to view the different types of membership available.
- As an existing Customer, I want to be able to book a tee time.

The management of the golf club want to create an online presence for the club and provide information about the course with the objective to get additional Customers both as occasional golfers and to increase the total number of members.
