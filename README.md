The purpose of this project is to create a static website for a golf club using a mobile-first design approach. The website is a single page design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap technologies learned throughout the first five modules in the Full Stack Web Developer course with Code Institute.

Grange Castle Golf Club was selected as the existing official website is not mobile user friendly.
